<h2>Birkhoff and the Alexandrov specialization order</h2>

<p>
One calls an ``Alexandrov topology'' a topological space where an
arbitrary intersection of open sets is open, or equivalently, every
point has a least neighbourhood. Alexandrov called it a ``discrete
space''.
</p><p>
The Alexandrov specialization theorem characterizes an Alexandrov
topology in terms of a quasi-order, that is, a reflexive and
transitive relation on that space. An Alexandrov topology on E and a
quasiorder <img src="tr.gif" align="bottom"> on E correspond as
follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> p <img src="tr.gif" align="bottom"> q iff p belongs to the
     closure of {q};
</li><li> the open sets are the upper sets for <img src="tr.gif" align="bottom">, that is, sets X with (p <img src="in.gif" align="bottom"> X, p <img src="tr.gif" align="bottom"> q) implies
     (q <img src="in.gif" align="bottom"> X).
</li></ol>
<p>
Moreover that quasiorder is an order relation (i.e., it is
antisymmetric) iff the topology satisfies the T0 separation axiom.
</p><p>
The usual reference for this result is [2], as well as Alexandrov's
later works (such as his topology book with Hopf, or his monograph on
combinatorial topology).
</p><p>
In fact, while developing his theory, Alexandrov discussed with
Birkhoff. In [1] Alexandrov proposed the axioms for a ``discrete
space'' and stated that it corresponded to a partially ordered
set. Birkhoff answered him in [3], and among other things stated that
he was studying similar structures in the framework of abstract
algebra. Then Alexandrov published his results in [2], in particular
the specialization theorem.  The same year Birkhoff published [4],
where he proved that a ``complete ring of sets'' (family of sets
closed under arbitrary union and intersection, including void ones)
corresponds to a quasiorder. A ``complete ring of sets'' means exactly
the same thing as ``Alexandrov topology'', and the quasiorder given by
Birkhoff is the same as the one given by Alexandrov, but in another
wording.
</p><p>
Birkhoff showed also that the ``complete ring of sets'' is a
``complete field of sets'' (the family is also closed under
complementation) iff the quasiorder is an equivalence relation (i.e.,
it is symmetric); in topological terms, it means that the open sets
coincide with the closed sets.
</p><p>
Therefore the specialization theorem attributed to Alexandrov is in
some way also due to Birkhoff.
